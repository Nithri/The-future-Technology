    <h3>The Applications</h3>
     <p>Apps are now an integral part of our lives. They definitely make our daily life easier, providing interesting knowledge, inspiring content and communication with the world. However, it is not difficult to get lost in this easily accessible world. This is not surprising, since the first apps of this type for the phone only started appearing about 10 years ago. Reviewing the app market today, one may be surprised how they interfere in almost every part of our lives! Sapio Research and DoubleVerify recently decided to conduct a study that looked at how much time we spend per day browsing the Internet. The exact average time was 6 hours and 59 minutes, where previously it was around 3-4 hours.</p>

    <h3>IoT - the future of our everyday life</h3>
     <p>We often don't realize how often these types of items surround us. It is said that currently the number of such devices is more than 50 billion. Examples of such devices include smart watches, which measure our pulse rate and other aspects based on which they later create charts with an average of, for example, last week, and recommend their own recommendations. There are also many devices in the home appliance store that have a smart function and assist us in our daily functioning. IoT devices are also widely used in security and city operations.</p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
     <p>Artificial intelligence is an interesting and very popular topic these days. Many people can already see that it is slowly making its way into our daily lives, and it is sure to be used in many ways in the future. It is a system that should mimic human intelligence by using the knowledge it already has and learning more things based on information gathering. This theme is sometimes used in science fiction films, interestingly often with a negative message. However, it is certainly an amazing mechanism that is still being developed especially since we receive in our hands special tools like for example ChatGPT recently.</p>

    <h3>Health, medicine, the extension of human life</h3>
     <p>What is the element that is always repeated when wishing each other well? Of course, health. Although there is so much talk about it, most people still pay little attention to it on a daily basis. Little by little they neglect themselves more and more each day, not noticing no difference until suddenly disbelief! Visible effects appear, and then it's often much more difficult to solve the problem. In response to this, medicine joining forces with modern technology is developing in an intriguing direction. Computers, lasers, robots that perform detailed operations are already the things we use. Thanks to them we have new opportunities for research, treatment resulting in extending the length of our lives. The trend of robotization in medicine has been growing significantly for several years and is worth following closely.</p>

    <h3>Development of Neurotechnology</h3>
     <p>Not long ago, the first computers and then smartphones were something new to us, and once unreal. However, the world is still rushing forward, and soon we may witness amazing technology related to neurotechnology. For years, scientists have been studying the topic of brain-computer connection. An experiment that made headlines a few years ago is BrainNet, which is a system that allows communication via brain waves. The scientists who developed this technology have proven that it is possible, albeit in a severely limited form for now. It is, however, a good prelude to further experimentation. That was a few years ago, while a popular topic today is a company owned by Elon Musk - Neuralink. Founded in 2016, it is still hiring new people and working on inventing an implant that can be inserted into the brain. It will allow advanced cooperation and communication between the machine and the human mind, for example, a smartphone that we will be able to operate with our mind, and this is just the beginning...</p>

    <h3>Space exploration</h3>
     <p>From the landing and first step on the moon in 1969 to the first photo of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, many years have passed. Many, too, of trials and sacrifices that cost lives but provided valuable lessons. The cosmic world seems incredibly fascinating as well as complicated. Its endless expansion, different passage of time, size and infinity, the phenomena occurring there seem to us something almost unreal. Due to our limitations, it is probably the most difficult subject of the present. There are many questions and doubts, and it takes a lot of time to find the answers. Nonetheless, it is worth exploring this topic more strongly.... on the horizon soon is spaceflight, and perhaps a colony on Mars?</p>
